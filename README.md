# Hashing script

Simple Python 3 script that takes a CSV of items to be hashed via SHA256 and outputs a txt file

1. Export email addresses as a csv
2. Save the CSV in the same folder as this script
3. Run the script from terminal 

NB: We assume the file has no headers! If your CSV does have headers either delete from th CSV or ignore the first line in the txt file.
